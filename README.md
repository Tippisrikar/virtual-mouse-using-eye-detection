Virtual Mouse Using Eye Tracking 👁️🖱️
This project demonstrates an innovative virtual mouse system that allows users to control their computer cursor using eye movements, eliminating the need for a physical mouse. By leveraging computer vision and machine learning techniques, the system tracks the user's eye gaze to determine cursor position and performs actions like clicks and drags.

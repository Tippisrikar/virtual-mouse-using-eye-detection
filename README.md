Virtual Mouse Using Eye Tracking üëÅÔ∏èüñ±Ô∏è
This project demonstrates an innovative virtual mouse system that allows users to control their computer cursor using eye movements, eliminating the need for a physical mouse. By leveraging computer vision and machine learning techniques, the system tracks the user's eye gaze to determine cursor position and performs actions like clicks and drags.


Software Requirement
1. Windows 7 or higher
2. PyCharm community Edition 2022.1.4
3. python v3.8

üìå Features
Eye Tracking: Uses a webcam to track the user's eye movement in real-time.
Cursor Control: Maps eye gaze to cursor movement on the screen.
Click Simulation: Blinks or prolonged gaze triggers left-click actions.
Custom Calibration: Adapts to individual users for increased accuracy.
User-Friendly Interface: Lightweight and easy to use.


Programming Language: 
Python


Libraries:
OpenCV: For image processing and real-time video feed.
NumPy: For efficient mathematical computations.
PyAutoGUI: For simulating mouse actions on the screen.
MediaPipe: For face and eye landmark detection.
